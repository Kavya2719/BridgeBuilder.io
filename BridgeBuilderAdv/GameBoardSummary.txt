In this class, our board is represented using a 2D character array.
It provides several methods for doing interaction with the board such as placeToken, displayBoard etc., which are implemented through simple traversing and manipulations to the board array.

In addition to the given methods, the class also includes 2 additional implemented methods:

1) getEmptyCellsList: This method returns a list of cells that are currently unoccupied.
This method is quite helpful and currently providing ease in implementing makeMove method of Engineer class, in Easy mode.

2) bfs: This method is used to check if there's a path exist between a source and the given destination in the board.
It plays a crucial role in the checkForWinDirection method and utilises multisource bfs algorithm for its implementation.

All the methods are thoroughly tested and validated through various test cases with several different paths for its working, with varying sizes of the board.
